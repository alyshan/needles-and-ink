        <p>A new experience with an old tradition.
        <br>
        <br>
        Body piercing by Scott Jania, one of New Zealand's two members of The Association of Professional Piercers. 21 years of experience - safe, simple, gentle.
        All certified implant grade titanium so there is no risk of any allergy with the jewellery. US made.
        <br>
        <br>
        We strive to provide the cleanest, best quality piercing to you. We use a Statim 2000 autoclave. This allows us to sterilise all components for each piercing, including the gloves, in an individual cycle right before your procedure. We use only Nitrile gloves, so there is no concern of latex allergies.
        <br>
        <br>
        We implement the use of sterile technique without clamps with each piercing procedure. By autoclave sterilising every item which will be used in the piercing procedure immediately prior to use, handling these items using sterile technique, then disposing of everything used, we reduce the risk of disease or infection transmission to you, our client. This allows for faster healing with minimal risk of complications.
        <br>
        <br>
        Our piercing techniques do not require the use of clamps, pliers, or other contrivances, which may cause damage to the tissue being pierced. By using gentle tissue massage and alignment techniques, we can provide you with a piercing which looks and feels good from day one.
        <br> 
        <br> 
        Our suggested aftercare for new piercings are simple to follow and requires no extra effort on your part. By providing you with a safe, simple, and gentle piercing, we eliminate the need for the use of complicated or risky, untested chemical aftercare regimes.
        <br>
        <br>
        Our jewellery for use in new piercings is certified to meet ASTM standards deemed safe for surgical implant materials. This gives you a guarantee that the materials placed in your new piercings have been scientifically tested to be safe for prolonged and repeated wear in the body. For initial piercings, we carry: glass (pyrex and quartz) and internally threaded titanium.</p>
